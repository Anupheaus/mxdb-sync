# Server subscriptions (`src/server/subscriptions/`)

Persistent server-side subscriptions: push live data to clients as the underlying data changes.

## Overview

Subscriptions differ from actions in that they remain active after the initial response: the server pushes updates whenever the collection changes. Each subscription is registered via `createServerCollectionSubscription` and backed by an `onChange` listener on `ServerDbCollection`.

## Contents

- `getAllSubscription.ts` — `serverGetAllSubscription` — pushes a full snapshot initially, then diffs on each change and pushes added/removed ids
- `querySubscription.ts` — `serverQuerySubscription` — paginated/filtered subscription; pushes matching records and total count on change
- `distinctSubscription.ts` — `serverDistinctSubscription` — distinct field values; pushes updates on change
- `createServerCollectionSubscription.ts` — factory that creates type-safe collection subscription handlers; wires `useCollection`, `onChange`, and `pushSubscriptionResultRecords`
- `pushSubscriptionResultRecords.ts` — routes records to the client via the S2C dispatch path (updates the `ServerDispatcher` filter with `addToFilter=true`)
- `internalSubscriptions.ts` — re-exports internal subscription descriptors from `src/common/internalSubscriptions.ts`

## Architecture

Each subscription:
1. Executes an initial fetch and pushes records via `pushSubscriptionResultRecords`.
2. Registers an `onChange` listener that re-fetches and pushes diffs whenever the collection changes.
3. Cleans up the `onChange` listener on `onUnsubscribe`.

`pushSubscriptionResultRecords` routes all records through `ServerDispatcher.push` (with `addToFilter=true`) so the SD filter stays in sync with what the client holds. This matters for subsequent change-stream events — the SD must know a client holds a record before it can send change-stream updates for it.

## Ambiguities and gotchas

- **Subscription data reaches the client as S2C cursor pushes, not action responses.** This is intentional — routing through the SD keeps the SD filter accurate. The client-side `useSubscription` hook uses the `ClientReceiver` path, not a direct response handler.
- **`serverGetAllSubscription` stores prior record ids** via `updateAdditionalData` to compute the `removedIds` diff on each change. If this data is lost (e.g. server restart mid-subscription), the next push sends a full snapshot, which is safe.
