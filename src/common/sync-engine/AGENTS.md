# Sync engine (`src/common/sync-engine/`)

Four-component protocol that moves data between clients and server. Framework-agnostic: it owns state and transitions; the layers above it own transport.

## Overview

| Component | Direction | Lives on | Responsibility |
|-----------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| `ClientDispatcher` (CD) | Client → Server | Client | Builds and dispatches C2S sync batches |
| `ServerReceiver` (SR) | Client → Server | Server | Receives batches, merges audits, replays, persists |
| `ServerDispatcher` (SD) | Server → Client | Server | Filters and dispatches S2C push payloads per client |
| `ClientReceiver` (CR) | Server → Client | Client | Applies S2C pushes to the local store |

One SR + SD pair per connected client on the server. One CD + CR pair per client.

- `syncEngine.stress.tests.ts` — 12-client convergence stress test (run 5+ times when touching race-sensitive code)
- `models.ts` — shared request/response types (`MXDBRecordStates`, `MXDBRecordCursors`, `MXDBUpdateRequest`, `ServerDispatcherFilter`, `SyncPausedError`)
- `utils.ts` — helpers shared across components

## Critical design rules

1. Audit entries are only ever **merged on the server** (`ServerReceiver`).
2. **No audit entries may ever be lost** — collapse/push/apply must preserve pending entries.
3. **Delete is final** — enforced at every boundary (CR, SD, SR, client store).
4. **In-memory read layer** — sync callbacks are synchronous because they hit an in-memory copy, not SQLite.
