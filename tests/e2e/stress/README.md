# Stress Test Suite

End-to-end integration tests for the MXDB-Sync library under concurrent, adversarial conditions. The goal is to prove that the sync engine preserves data integrity across many simultaneous clients, network disruptions, and server restarts.

---

## What it tests

The suite runs a single long-lived test scenario (`stress.tests.ts`) that exercises:

1. **Concurrent multi-client writes** — 20 clients each independently create, update, and delete records at random intervals, all hitting the same MongoDB collection at once.
2. **Random deletes** — each operation has an 8% chance of becoming a delete (capped at half the max record count), verifying that tombstones propagate correctly and records do not ghost-resurrect.
3. **Simulated network latency** — every CRUD call is preceded by a random 10–80 ms delay, mimicking real-world socket round-trip times.
4. **Flaky clients** — 3 of the 20 clients cycle through random disconnects (2–8 s down) and reconnects (5–15 s up) for most of the workload duration, verifying that clients can catch up after offline periods.
5. **Mid-workload server restart** — at 15 s into the 40 s workload, the server process is killed and respawned on the same port; clients are expected to reconnect and resync automatically with no data loss.
6. **Staggered client connections** — clients connect spread over 5 s to mirror real-world staggered user arrivals rather than a thundering herd.

---

## How it tests

### Workload phase (`stressRandomMixWorkload.ts`)

All 20 clients run concurrently as independent async workers for 40 s. Each worker loop:

1. Waits a random CRUD gap (2–4 s) then a random network latency (10–80 ms).
2. Rolls a delete (8% chance) against a randomly chosen record the client currently sees.
3. Otherwise creates a new record (if below the 20-record cap) or mutates an existing one by randomly changing 1–4 fields (`value`, `name`, `metadata`, `tags`).

Simultaneously, three background tasks run in parallel with the workers:
- **Server restart loop** — fires at 15 s.
- **Connectivity disruption loops** — one per flaky client.
- All workers and background tasks race to their respective deadlines with `Promise.all`.

### Settle phase

After the workload deadline, the test polls until the server's live records exactly match the client oracle (or times out at 90 s). This gives in-flight replication and reconnection sync time to complete.

A final grace period of 10 s follows, then the test waits for all clients to reach a fully idle state (no pending sync activity, all connected) before taking the final snapshot.

---

## Oracles and integrity checks

The test uses two independent oracles that must all agree with each other and with the server at assertion time.

### 1. Client oracle (`stressClientOracle.ts`)

Queries every client's local IndexedDB for its current live rows. Conflicts between clients are resolved by ULID-based last-write-wins: for each record ID, the client whose last audit entry ULID is lexicographically greatest wins. This mirrors the exact same ordering the sync engine uses internally.

### 2. Records-of-truth (`recordsOfTruth.ts`)

A harness-side audit log that mirrors what the client `DbCollection` writes, using the same auditor functions (`createAuditFrom`, `updateAuditWith`, `auditor.delete`). Every time the test harness calls `client.upsert()` or `client.remove()`, the corresponding function is called on the truth log:

- `recordHarnessUpsert(clientId, prev, next)` — creates a `Created` entry for new IDs, or appends an `Updated` entry for existing ones (including post-delete updates, which do not resurrect the record — only a `Restored` entry can do that).
- `recordHarnessDelete(recordId)` — directly appends a `Deleted` entry, bypassing the short-circuit that would normally skip a double-delete, to match server-side merge semantics for racing deletes.

`getExpectedState()` materialises live records by replaying each audit through the same `createRecordFrom` function the sync engine uses, so deleted IDs naturally produce no output.

### Integrity assertion (`stressIntegrityAssertions.ts`)

`assertIntegrity` compares the server's live MongoDB documents against the client oracle and throws with a detailed diff if any of these fail:

| Check | What it detects |
|---|---|
| Missing IDs | Records the oracle expects but the server doesn't have |
| Extra IDs | Records the server has that the oracle doesn't know about |
| Value mismatches | Records present on both sides but with different field values |

### Audit-level comparison (`truthVsServerAuditCompare.ts`)

Beyond record values, the final report compares the raw audit documents in MongoDB (`_sync` collection) against the records-of-truth audit log entry-by-entry. This catches subtler bugs — e.g. lost audit entries, duplicate entries, or unexpected `Branched` anchor entries (which are disallowed in the stress test).

### Final report (`stressFinalReport.ts`)

Emitted once at the end (and on teardown if the test crashes early). Logs a summary that covers all four alignment checks:

- **Client oracle vs server** — did every client's view of live records end up on the server?
- **Records-of-truth vs client oracle** — does the harness's op-log replay agree with what clients actually see?
- **Records-of-truth vs server** — does the harness's op-log replay agree with what MongoDB actually holds?
- **Audit-level truth vs server** — do the raw audit entry sequences in MongoDB match the harness's audit trail exactly?

All four must pass for the test to succeed.

## Logs

Each run writes a timestamped NDJSON log to `tests/e2e/stress/logs/stress-<timestamp>.log`. Each line is a structured event (`test_start`, `client_upsert`, `client_remove`, `server_restart`, `client_connect`, `client_disconnect`, `sync_response`, `validation_summary`, `error`, …) with a `phase` field marking which stage of the test emitted it. The final `validation_summary` line is the definitive pass/fail record for the run.

---

## Running

```bash
pnpm vitest run tests/e2e/stress/stress.tests.ts
```

The test has a 300 s timeout for the main `it` block and a 90 s timeout for `beforeAll` (client connections).
